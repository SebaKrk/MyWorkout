/// `AppStorageProtocol` provides a way to manage key application states, such as the completion
/// of the onboarding process. This protocol abstracts the underlying storage mechanism, allowing
/// for easier testing and flexibility in implementation.

    ///
    /// - `true`: The user has completed the onboarding process.
    /// - `false`: The user has not completed the onboarding process.
    var hasCompletedOnboarding: Bool { get set }
    
    /// Marks the onboarding process as completed.
    ///
    /// This method sets the `hasCompletedOnboarding` property to `true` and persists
    /// the change to the underlying storage.

    /// Resets the onboarding completion state.
    ///
    /// This method sets the `hasCompletedOnboarding` property to `false`, effectively
    /// resetting the onboarding state for the application.
